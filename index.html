            <h2>Jesse Banda</h2>
            <h4>Sales Director</h4>
            <p style= "">I have been in the car business since January 25, 1995. I was born in Dallas, TX, and found my way to the Houston area at a young age. In 1995, I was a part of the team that introduced Kia Motors to the Houston area working at David McDavid Kia. Since than I have worked at Honda, Nissan Chevrolet, Ford, GMC-Pontiac, Volvo, Buick, BMW, Infiniti, Toyota , Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and Most recently Hyundai-Genesis. By working at these Franchises and attending Auctions in California, Florida, Nevada and Texas it has given me the knowledge to understand the Used Car Market. I enjoy helping everyone, and assisting them with their car buying needs. what I offer is knowledge and experience in handling dealership consultants so that you walk away with a great customer experience and a great price with low interest rates, and financing options. Feel Free to contact me should you have any questions or concerns, I know that I can help you in finding your next dream car.  </p>
